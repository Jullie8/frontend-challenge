# New Assistance Request Form

A single page application created with React and a fake-api executed from docker. This request app was built as part of a code challenge.

## Features

- Parts of this application can be used elsewhere in a larger application
- App contains Field validations. When something isn't right a div is user is notified 
Data integrity. Can the user submit multiple instances of the same request? (They probably shouldn't.)
Styling. Try to mimic the wireframe and use Twitter Bootstrap 3 to style it (don't worry about changing the colors).
Limit external dependencies wherever possible.
Can you include any tests?
Include a README.
